## Up to date Windows 10 Keylogger built using visual studio 2019

 * Features: enable/disable & exit

 * Generates a file called KLogger.exe
 * KLogger.exe generates a klog.csv file
 * klog.csv can be imported into most modern spreadsheet apps
 * ex: (Google Sheets, Micorsoft Excel, Libre Office Calc, ...)
 * I recommend Libre Office Calc for privacy reasons.
 * You can then build visual graphs and such for personal use, or sort data.

#### I initially made this for gaming but it has many uses if needed.
